<h1>The Psychic Game</h1>
<p>Guess what letter I'm thinking of</p>

<p>Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)</p>

<p>Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)</p>

<p>Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)</p>

<p>Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)</p>

<p>When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).</p>

<p>When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).</p>
